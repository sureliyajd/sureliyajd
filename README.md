## 🧠 About Me

I build **production-grade systems end to end** — from backend architecture and frontend experiences to cloud infrastructure, CI/CD, and long-term scalability.

My core strength is not just writing code, but **designing, deploying, operating, and evolving real systems** that handle real users, traffic, and constraints.

I actively leverage **AI-assisted development** (Claude, GPT-4, Cursor, Copilot) to move fast — while applying strong engineering judgment to ensure **clean architecture, correctness, and maintainability**.
